title: Moving to GitHub Pages.
---

Why am I moving to GitHub Pages? My previous blog site is on 
[asp.net](http://asp.net/lichen) whch is own by Microsoft. 
Now that I am working for Amazon, it is probably a good idea to blog about AWS there.
GitHub Pages appears to be a good choice because it is a static site generator so
that I do not need a database. To create a blog post, I only need to create a
new markdown file and check it into Github. Github natively supports a static site
generator called Jekyll and it will automatically generate the site for me. 
How do I host discussions then? There is a wonderful free service from Disqus.com.
