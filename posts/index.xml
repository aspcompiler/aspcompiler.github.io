Chapter 5 is a very important chapter that introduces control flow.
The key to the control flow is Phi operation. If you previously skipped the SSA form, it is not mandatory. Make you fully understand the sections before Computing minimal SSA using dominance frontiers. This knowledge is very important to understand Chapter 7.
Chapter 5 also introduces looks like llvm-as and opt.</description></item><item><title>The speed of gRPC Python is very impressive and that deserves a dive</title><link>https://aspcompiler.github.io/posts/grpc-python-is-fast/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jul 2023 15:43:15 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://aspcompiler.github.io/posts/grpc-python-is-fast/</guid><description>Intro Recently, I did a small experiment to compare the performance of gRPC Python and other languages. The result is very impressive. I would expect to see a interpreted code many times slower than a native code. Intuitively, this can only happen if the code is mostly native. Let us dive in to see how it was implemented.
gRPC Python implementation gRPC has 2 major parts. Its serializer is built upon protobuf.</description></item><item><title>LLVM for the impatient (2)</title><link>https://aspcompiler.github.io/posts/llvm-for-the-impatient-2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jul 2023 23:28:48 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://aspcompiler.github.io/posts/llvm-for-the-impatient-2/</guid><description>Introduction In the previous installation, we provided a way to get started hands-on with LLVM with minimum effort. In this blog, we will follow the chapter 3 and chapter 4 of the LLVM tutorial to generate code.
Chapter 3 is about building the LLVM intermediate representation(IR) from the AST. Chapter 4 is about optimization passes as well as the just-in-time(JIT) compilation.
While the LLVM tutorials are very detailed, I will try to summarize the key points and provide some additional explanations.</description></item><item><title>LLVM for the impatient (1)</title><link>https://aspcompiler.github.io/posts/llvm-for-the-impatient-1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Feb 2023 14:42:43 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://aspcompiler.github.io/posts/llvm-for-the-impatient-1/</guid><description>Intro LLVM is a common compiler backend. If you are writing a new language, you just need to target the LLVM backend. Then you will be able to use all the great optimization passes and target all the platforms that LLVM supports.
A best way to get started with LLVM is by following the tutorial. The intended audience for this series is:
Those who are learning from the tutorial but sometimes lost in the details.</description></item><item><title>The Remaking of My Blog with Hugo</title><link>https://aspcompiler.github.io/posts/remaking-of-my-blog/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jan 2023 22:16:35 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://aspcompiler.github.io/posts/remaking-of-my-blog/</guid><description>The remaking I have not blogged since I joined Amazon in 2016. My initial focus was delivery results and then I had to deal with a massive volume of customer interactions and data as the result. Now I want to blog again as I spend significant time doing R&amp;amp;D at AWS Center for Quantum Computing and I need to capture what I learnt, and hopefully that benefits others as well. My original blog site was developed on github pages using Jekyll.</description></item></channel></rss>
