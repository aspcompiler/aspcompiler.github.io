The result is very impressive. I would expect to see a interpreted code many times slower than a native code. Intuitively, this can only happen if the code is mostly native. Let us dive in to see how it was implemented.
gRPC Python implementation gRPC has 2 major parts. Its serializer is built upon protobuf.</description></item></channel></rss>
