In this blog, we will follow the chapter 3 and chapter 4 of the LLVM tutorial to generate code.
Chapter 3 is about building the LLVM intermediate representation(IR) from the AST. Chapter 4 is about optimization passes as well as the just-in-time(JIT) compilation.
While the LLVM tutorials are very detailed, I will try to summarize the key points and provide some additional explanations.</description></item><item><title>Getting Started With LLVM (1)</title><link>https://aspcompiler.github.io/posts/getting-started-with-llvm-1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Feb 2023 14:42:43 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://aspcompiler.github.io/posts/getting-started-with-llvm-1/</guid><description>Why should I learn LLVM?
