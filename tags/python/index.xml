In this post, we will try to build a simple Python module with a few features using PyO3. For exhaustive documentation, please refer to the PyO3 user guide.
Setup To learn how to setup PyO3, please follow the PyO3 user guide. I have save my code in this repository. Please follow the README there to run my code.
A Simple Python Module Let us implement a single Python function in Rust.</description></item><item><title>The speed of gRPC Python is very impressive and that deserves a dive</title><link>https://aspcompiler.github.io/posts/grpc-python-is-fast/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jul 2023 15:43:15 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://aspcompiler.github.io/posts/grpc-python-is-fast/</guid><description>Intro Recently, I did a small experiment to compare the performance of gRPC Python and other languages. The result is very impressive. I would expect to see a interpreted code many times slower than a native code. Intuitively, this can only happen if the code is mostly native. Let us dive in to see how it was implemented.
gRPC Python implementation gRPC has 2 major parts. Its serializer is built upon protobuf.</description></item></channel></rss>
